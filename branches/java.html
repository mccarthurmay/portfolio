        <p>My school, Ravena-Coeymans-Selkirk, has had a very successful running in FIRST robotics, reaching regional championships every year for the past five years.
            Sadly, it was never highly advertised or congratulated as our school culture primarily followed sports. Their room was taken away after the fourth year, leaving the team
            with a corner of a small computer lab. When it came time to practice, there was only enough space for a third of the playing field. This is the year I joined the team.
        </p> 

        <p> I was lucky enough to accidentally befriend one of the members of the team through calculus, later mentioning their need for a new programmer. This was due to a very unfortunate situation
        where the previous programmers taught a student that moved to another school right before this season. The team was left with nothing and no ideas of what to do. With this, I
        offered my help with limited programming knowledge. </p>

        <p>For the first few months, we were blueprinting, building, and exploring strategies to quickly complete our tasks. Coding-wise, we could only complete the driving portion
            as our strategies to lift cones were far varied and quickly changing. It was only until the day before our first competition did we have a definite design and only a written
            idea of what we should be coding. Luckily enough, my fellow co-captain, Nick Cifone, and I pulled through with a very rudimentary program to drive omnidirectionally as well as 
            lifting a linear slide.

        <p>With this program <a href="./java_res/code.html">here</a>, we were able to pull through with a second place during the Albany Academy Qualifier, sadly unable to make it to states. We still had many physical errors
            as well as some coding optimizations that can be prioritized to help the drivers. We worked hard on our robot for the next month preparing for what could have been our last chance 
            at going to states.</p>

        <p>The Broadalbin-Perth Qualifier was a breeze. We ended first in the qualifier and secured the spot to the Utica Regionals competition. Although we ended our season in 10th place
            at this competition, we were still ecstatic with our accomplishments. This was the team's fifth year in a row going to states, leaving the underclassmen with a yearn to keep the streak.

        <p>Unfortunately, our final product of code is stored locally on the robot which I do not have access to. We continued to give back to our community during our hosted STEM day and the Ravena Music
            and Arts festival, where the STEM day was even reported by our <a href="https://theupstater.com/news/reaching-a-younger-generation-with-the-allure-of-stem/">local news agency</a>.
